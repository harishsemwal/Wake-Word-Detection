## Introduction

Wake-Word-Detection aims to provide an efficient and accurate method for detecting specific words in audio input. This can be used in various applications such as virtual assistants, voice control systems, and more.

## Features

- Real-time wake word detection
- High accuracy with low false-positive rate
- Easy to customize with different wake words
- Lightweight and optimized for embedded systems

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (for model training and inference)
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wake-word-detection.git
    cd wake-word-detection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Detector

To start the wake word detection, run:
```bash
python run_detection.py --model path/to/your/model --input your_audio_input_device
